We have created an ant build for the project, so if you have apache ant install, simply run 'ant' in this directory, and it will clean, compile, build and run the program.
You need to have java8 and javaFX installed.

If ant is not avaliable, the source files are in src, and the main method is in class:
ui.application.GUI
